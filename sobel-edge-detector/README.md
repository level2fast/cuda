## **üìù Project Description**  
This project is an application that uses the CUDA library to implement an algorithm that performs edge detection using the sobel filter. An image is convolved with the sobel filter and stored on the JetsonTX2 board for analysis. CUDA is used to speed up the processing of the image and a set of tests were ran to determine the best block size to use when processing. 
 
## **Sobel Operator** 
The operator uses two 3√ó3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate approximations of the derivatives ‚Äì one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical.The Sobel operator uses two 3√ó3 kernels to approximate the gradient of the image intensity.  

The horizontal (`Fx`) and vertical (`Fy`) Sobel filters are defined as:

### **Sobel Operator - Horizontal (`Fx`)**
| -1  |  0  | +1  |
|----|----|----|
| -2  |  0  | +2  |   
| -1  |  0  | +1  |

### **Sobel Operator - Vertical (`Fy`)**
| -1  | -2  | -1  |
|----|----|----|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |   
| +1  | +2  | +1  |

If we define **A** as the source image, and **Gx** and **Gy** as two images which at each point contain the horizontal and vertical derivative approximations respectively, the computations are as follows:

**Gx** = **Fx** * **A** <br/>
**Gy** = **Fy** * **A**

where `*` represents the **2D convolution operation** applied to the image.

## **Profile Report**
A [report](https://github.com/level2fast/cuda/blob/main/sobel-edge-detector/docs/Report.pdf) was produced comparing the speed of the two different implementations of the algorithm. One using CUDA and the GPU. The other using the CPU and the OpenCV library.
